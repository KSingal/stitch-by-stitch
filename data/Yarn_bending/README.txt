DATASET INFORMATION

The contents of this dataset describe samples of yarn subjected to cantilever experiments to extract the bending modulus. Data was collected in Fall 2022. It is to be used with the (as of file generation date, unpublished) manuscript:
"Programming Mechanics in Knitted Materials, Stitch by Stitch"

CONTENTS

The folders "acrylic_images" and "cotton_images" contain the raw images of yarn samples being draped over a table ledge. There are five samples each for four lengths of yarn: 10 cm, 15 cm, 20 cm, and 25 cm. The folders contain the raw images in HEIC format as well as the cropped versions of each image saved as a JPEG/JPG. 

The Mathematica notebook "bendingModulus_calculation.nb" is used to analyze the experimental images and extract the yarn's bending modulus. 

MATERIAL INFORMATION

The acrylic yarn is Brava worsted yarn (28455-White) from KnitPicks(™), which is 100% acrylic. The cotton yarn is 082L Pearl cotton 3/2 color 1800-13 sapphire from Halcyon Yarn(™) yarn, which is 100% cotton.
