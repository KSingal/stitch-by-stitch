DATASET INFORMATION

The contents of this dataset describe samples of yarn subjected to tests performed by a Zwick/Roell Z010 Universal Testing Machine (UTM). Data was collected in April 2022.
It is to be used with the (as of file generation date, unpublished) manuscript:
"Programming Mechanics in Knitted Materials, Stitch by Stitch"

CONTENTS

The excel file named "compressionTests.xls" contain yarn compression data for both the cotton and acrylic samples. There are 8 sheets present. 

The first named "Yarn Diameters" list the diameters for each of the 7 samples (4 cotton and 3 acrylic) before being used in the compression experiments. The four following sheets are labeled "cotton-X" with X corresponding to the sample number. The last three are labeled "acrylic-X" with X corresponding to the sample number. These sheets contain all the data from the UTM. 

For all the data sheets, there are five columns dedicated to each sample: "Test Time", "Standard force", "Strain", "Tool separation", and "Work".  

MATERIAL INFORMATION

The acrylic yarn is Brava worsted yarn (28455-White) from KnitPicks(™), which is 100% acrylic. The cotton yarn is 082L Pearl cotton 3/2 color 1800-13 sapphire from Halcyon Yarn(™) yarn, which is 100% cotton. 

APPARATUS INFORMATION

Segments of yarn were tested with a Zwick/Roell Z010 Universal Testing Machine (UTM). The yarn samples were cut directly from the original skein of yarn used to craft the fabric samples. For the compression experiments, the yarn samples were placed under the UTM probe tip and on top of a custom made stage made from laser cut acrylic sheets. The stage matched the exact shape of the UTM probe tip such that the samples were compressed evenly from the top and bottom.
